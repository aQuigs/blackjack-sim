# Cursor Rules for blackjack-sim

- ALWAYS run `pre-commit run --all-files` after making any code changes.
- Do not consider a change complete until all pre-commit hooks pass (including tests, lint, type checks, and coverage).
- If pre-commit fails, fix the issues and rerun until it passes.
- Communicate this requirement in all future code reviews and automation.
- Also be willing to update .cursorrules to help remember context
- Don't ever pip install anything directly. Use requirements.txt
